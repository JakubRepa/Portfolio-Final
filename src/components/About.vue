                  It all started as passion for drawing during my childhood. This led me to study
                  Graphic Design at high school and ultimately resolved in pursuing degree in Multimedia Design at
                  business academy in Denmark. <br><br>
                  As for now I do mostly Graphic Design, but thanks to evolution of my personality and interests,
                  I also found love for Marketing, Web Design, Visual Storytelling, Video Production and many more
                  things.

                  Businesses are moving their audience engagement and advertising to online platforms which emphasize visual content
                  that informs, educates and entertains. This is done through different media formats such as text, images, graphics, audio and video. 
                  <br><br> For me personally, it means to deliver impactful message in most suitable format and way to the people at right place and right time.

            message whether for business or individual. If you want to know me a bit more in depth please
            feel free to watch this video, about how I got to do what I do.
